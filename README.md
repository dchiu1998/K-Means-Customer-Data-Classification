# K-Means-Customer-Data-Classification
A self implemented K-means clustering program. Classify a customer dataset with 3 features using the unsupervised learning algorithm.

Have the customer.csv file in the same directory and run the program. Choose the number of clusters (K), and type of initialization (random datapoints or Kmeans++) from the main method. Returns the clusters and plot of the clusters after classification is complete.
